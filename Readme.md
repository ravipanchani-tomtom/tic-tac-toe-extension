# Tic Tac Toe P2P Game

This project is a peer-to-peer Tic Tac Toe game that can be played both as a Chrome extension and as a standalone web page hosted on GitHub Pages. The game uses PeerJS for peer-to-peer communication, allowing two players to connect and play in real-time. Built using gpt-4o and prompt engineering :)
